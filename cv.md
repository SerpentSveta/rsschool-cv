## About me
I am 44 years old, I’m a content manager.

At the start of my career, I worked at the advertising department of a tour operator. I was a catalog layout designer and also was engaged in site support.

I was editing HTML and CSS code, and I decided that I had to learn how to create it myself, instead of just editing and filling it in.

**CMS**: Wordpress, Joomla

## Code examples
```
function solution(number){
  let sum = 0;
  
  if (number < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  for (i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
      sum = sum + i;
    }    
  }
  return sum;
}
